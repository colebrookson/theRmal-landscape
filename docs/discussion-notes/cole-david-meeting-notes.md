## 10 September 2024

Overall, discussed first steps and how to begin tackling the problem. General question, is how do resource and thermal constraints influence the distribution of consumers across a landscape? And what does that look like? Subsequently, when you have said consumers distributed across a landscape, how does introducing infection dynamics impact that? 

* My pre-meeting notes: 

    * ideal-free distribution in terms of resources might be different than ideal free in terms of minimizing disease spread? because there might be a relationship of the space use driving disease patterns, but also one of the inverse -- we do see this in nature
    * extension could be something like barriers on the landscape?
    * could an ideal-free be derived for each of the three of interest (temp, resources, disease), then combinations therein? 

* Notes from the chat: 

    * take the landscape that has variation in resource supply and temperature (uncorrelated, two overlaid distributions), and then you ask what the distribution of populations sizes at locality scales 
    * some nice things come from Jensen's inequalityÂ does where you start your infection (spatially, i.e. like a patch have an effect on what the dynamics end up looking like) 
    * the key would be to solve the two equilibrium solutions for variation in S and T (temperature) 
    * first pass, bruke force loop through this calculation and draw S from some random distribution, draw $T$ from some set, and then what is the resultant $C$ -- the negative value of $C$ is just the $C = 0$, -- if you only imagine a tiny bit of variation, you'll see something pretty different
