\section*{Introduction}\label{s:introduction}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Direct transmission of infectious disease is driven largely by physical proximity between infected hosts and susceptible hosts. 
    \item Physical proximity can be driven by complex social dynamics, but in a simplified framework is most easily described by the probability that organisms making foraging choices on a landscape chose the same patch and then subsequently a transmission event occurs
    \item Foraging choices on a landscape is driven largely by resource availability
    \item In an environment where organisms are sensitive to the thermal landscape as well, choices will be made not just based on resource availability but on the thermal suitability of various patches
    \item A simplified landscape can therefore be thought of as jointly described by the thermal and resource properties of a given patch 
    \item Transmission dynamics on a landscape will therefore be characterized by these factors as well
    \item In this simplified framework then, the probability of a single infected individual transmitting a generalized pathogen to another individual is modulated by the thermal and resource landscapes
    \item the
